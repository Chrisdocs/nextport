			The outdoors call me, and I try to spend as much time there as I
			can. Whether it's a walk through our local park or a multi-day
			backpacking trip, I'm game. Then there is the more obvious passion
			- technology. I love seeing how technology can change the world,
			and hopefully in ways which benefit the people who use them.
